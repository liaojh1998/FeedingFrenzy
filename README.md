# FeedingFrenzy
High School Computer Science Project made by Brittny Efendy and me. Main focus on tweaking of Java Graphics and applying theoretical computational geometry into practical fields.

This repository contains the original source code of the program, which is perfectly compilable and executable on JDK 7 if all files are downloaded (except for the multiple FeedingFrenzy(n).java files that have a bracketed number, they simply represent previous drafts of the game).
The source code contains explanations on each individual objects and its executions.

A small random pink fish will be stuck in the middle of the sea. It will follow your mouse and you need to eat as many small fish as possible to live.
Along your journey, youâ€™ll find Orcas that will haunt you and possibly kill you, seaweeds that curves around, crab that move beneath you, and corals and rocks that decorates the surrounding.
The objective of the game is to simply eat as many fishes as possible before you get killed by the Orcas.

Built on JCreator Pro v5.00

Special thanks to Mrs. Truong for her amazing support throughout my junior year and her thought-provoking Computer Science lectures.
